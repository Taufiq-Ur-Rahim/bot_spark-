1. Introduction
================
BotSpark is an AI-powered interview simulation platform designed to help candidates practice interviews and allow administrators to manage questions, monitor sessions, and analyze candidate performance. The system supports voice input/output, session analytics, and robust admin controls, providing a modern, user-friendly experience for both candidates and admins.

---

2. Problem Statement
====================
Traditional interview preparation methods lack interactivity, real-time feedback, and scalability. Candidates often struggle to find realistic practice environments, while organizations need efficient tools to manage and analyze interview data. There is a need for a platform that simulates real interview scenarios, supports voice interaction, and provides comprehensive analytics for administrators.

---

3. Project Objectives
=====================
- Develop a full-stack web application for AI-powered interview simulation.
- Enable candidates to practice interviews with voice/text input and receive instant feedback.
- Provide admins with tools to manage questions, monitor candidate progress, and analyze performance.
- Ensure secure authentication, role-based access, and a modern, responsive UI.

---

4. System Architecture
======================
- **Frontend:** React SPA with Bootstrap, voice utilities, and responsive design.
- **Backend:** Django REST Framework with JWT authentication, SQLite database.
- **APIs:** RESTful endpoints for users, questions, interviews, and analytics.
- **Deployment:** Local development, ready for cloud deployment.

5. Technology Stack
===================
- **Frontend:** React, React Bootstrap, CSS, Web Speech API
- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework, JWT, SQLite
- **Other:** CORS, CSV import/export, RESTful APIs

---

6. Features
===========
6.1 Candidate Features
----------------------
- Registration with username, email, and password
- Login and secure session management
- Chat-like interview UI with animated Q&A bubbles
- Voice input (speech-to-text) and output (text-to-speech)
- 10-question interview, CSP-based selection, time limits
- Session summary and feedback
- One interview per candidate unless unblocked by admin
- Consistent branding and modern UI

6.2 Admin Features
-------------------
- Dashboard with tabs for Questions, Candidates, and Analytics
- Add, edit, delete, and bulk import/export questions (CSV)
- Responsive tables with word-wrapping and wide layouts
- View all registered candidates, their sessions, and analytics
- Unblock candidates to allow retakes
- Remove all interview records for a candidate (and block them until unblocked)
- Download candidate summaries as CSV
- View overall stats, topic-wise performance, and most-missed questions

---

7. Implementation Details
=========================
7.1 Frontend
------------
- React SPA with routing and protected routes
- Bootstrap for layout and components
- Custom CSS for branding and responsiveness
- Voice utilities using Web Speech API
- API integration for authentication, questions, and session management
- Animated chat UI for interview simulation

7.2 Backend
-----------
- Django REST Framework for API endpoints
- JWT authentication for secure access
- User model extended with role, email, interview status, and block status
- Question model with text, topic, difficulty, and time_required
- Interview session and session question models for tracking progress
- Admin endpoints for analytics, candidate management, and CSV import/export

---

8. Key Code and Design Decisions
===============================
- Used JWT for stateless, secure authentication
- Role-based access control for candidate/admin separation
- CSP-based question selection for balanced interviews
- Responsive, accessible UI with Bootstrap and custom CSS
- Voice input/output for realistic interview experience
- Admin controls for unblocking and removing candidate records
- Email field added to user model and registration for better management

---

9. Testing and Validation
=========================
- Manual testing of all user flows (registration, login, interview, admin actions)
- Validation of form inputs and error handling
- Linter/ESLint and type checking for code quality
- Responsive design tested on multiple devices
- Backend tested with API tools (Postman)

---

10. Screenshots and Diagrams
============================

---

11. Challenges and Solutions
============================
- **CORS and API endpoint mismatches:** Fixed by proper configuration and consistent API paths.
- **Voice input/output integration:** Used Web Speech API and handled browser compatibility.
- **Table responsiveness:** Custom CSS for word-wrapping and wide layouts.
- **One-interview enforcement:** Backend logic and admin unblock controls.
- **Email management:** Added email to registration, user model, and admin dashboard.
- **Type/linter errors:** Fixed with type hints, ignores, and code cleanup.

---

12. Future Work
===============
- Email verification and password reset
- AI-powered feedback on answers
- Support for multiple interview rounds
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Cloud deployment and scaling

---

13. Conclusion
==============
BotSpark is a robust, modern, and user-friendly AI interview platform with full admin control and analytics. It provides a realistic interview experience for candidates and powerful management tools for admins. The project is ready for demonstration and further development.
